# Grahams-Algorithim-Interface

Using Java and FX packages, this project demonstrates the concept behind Grahams Algorithim by creating a randomly generated convex hull in an interface.

The program takes the user step by step and shows what points would be outlined in any specific setting. Using a for loop, the program creates 15 points with random coordinates. It then creates an object out of the points coordinates and stores it into an array.

Using a multitude of algorithims, the program decides where our outline will expand at each step. By the end, a fully formed shape will be created out of any of the 15 points to create the largest area possible.
